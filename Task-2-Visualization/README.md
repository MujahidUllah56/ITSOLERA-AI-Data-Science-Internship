**Task 2: Exploring and Visualizing a Simple Dataset**
Task Objective

The objective of this task is to explore and visualize a dataset to understand relationships between variables, data distribution, and potential outliers using matplotlib and seaborn.

**Approach
**
Loaded the Iris dataset using pandas.

Inspected the dataset structure and basic statistics.

Created visualizations including:

Scatter plots to analyze relationships between features.

Histograms to examine data distribution.

Box plots to detect outliers and compare feature spread across categories.

**Results and Insights
**
Scatter plots showed clear patterns and separation among different iris species.

Histograms revealed non-uniform distributions for some features.

Box plots highlighted variations and potential outliers across species.

Visualization improved understanding of feature behavior and relationships.
