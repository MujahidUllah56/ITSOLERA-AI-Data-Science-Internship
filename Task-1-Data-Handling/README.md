**Task 1: Data Handling with NumPy & Pandas**
Task Objective

The objective of this task is to build a strong foundation in data handling by loading, inspecting, cleaning, and manipulating a structured dataset using NumPy and pandas. This task focuses on understanding dataset structure and performing basic statistical analysis.

**Approach**

Loaded the dataset using the pandas library.

Inspected the dataset using .shape, .info(), .columns, and .head().

Performed data cleaning by handling missing values and removing duplicate records.

Used NumPy to perform array operations and calculate basic statistics such as mean, median, and standard deviation.

**Results and Insights**

The dataset was successfully cleaned and prepared for analysis.

No critical data quality issues remained after cleaning.

NumPy statistics provided a quick numerical summary of the dataset.

The cleaned dataset is now suitable for visualization and machine learning tasks.
