**Task 3: Predicting Insurance Claim Amounts**
Task Objective

The objective of this task is to predict medical insurance charges based on personal and lifestyle factors using a Linear Regression model.

**Approach**

Loaded and inspected the medical insurance dataset.

Encoded categorical variables and prepared features for modeling.

Split the data into training and testing sets.

Trained a Linear Regression model.

Evaluated the model using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

Visualized the impact of age, BMI, and smoking status on insurance charges.

**Results and Insights**

Smoking status had a strong impact on insurance charges.

Higher age and BMI were associated with higher medical costs.

The Linear Regression model provided reasonable prediction accuracy.

MAE and RMSE confirmed acceptable model performance.
