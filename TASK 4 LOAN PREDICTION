Task 4: Credit Risk Prediction
Task Objective

The objective of this task is to predict whether a loan applicant is likely to default on a loan based on personal, educational, and financial information. This is a binary classification problem aimed at assisting financial institutions in assessing credit risk.

Approach

Loaded the Loan Prediction dataset using the pandas library.

Inspected the dataset structure and identified missing values.

Handled missing data using appropriate techniques such as mode and median imputation.

Encoded categorical variables into numerical form.

Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using visualizations to analyze key features such as loan amount, education, and income.

Trained a Logistic Regression classification model.

Evaluated model performance using accuracy score and confusion matrix.

Results and Insights

Applicants with a valid credit history showed a higher probability of loan approval.

Education level had a noticeable impact on loan approval outcomes.

Logistic Regression achieved good accuracy for this binary classification task.

The confusion matrix demonstrated a balanced performance between approved and rejected loan predictions.
