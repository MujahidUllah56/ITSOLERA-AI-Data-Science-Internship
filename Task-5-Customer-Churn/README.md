**Task 5: Customer Churn Prediction (ANN)**
Task Objective

The objective of this task is to predict whether a bank customer is likely to churn (leave the bank) using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN).

**Approach**

Loaded and cleaned the churn dataset.

Removed irrelevant columns.

Encoded categorical features using Label Encoding and One-Hot Encoding.

Scaled numerical features for ANN performance.

Built and trained an ANN model using TensorFlow/Keras.

Evaluated the model using accuracy and confusion matrix.

Analyzed important features using ANN weights.
**
Results and Insights**

The ANN model achieved good accuracy in predicting customer churn.

Age, balance, and activity status were key factors influencing churn.

Active customers were less likely to leave the bank.

ANN effectively captured complex patterns in customer behavior.
